Lyx table parser
================

A simple python script to convert lyx files to tex files and extract tables from them.

I used it to create my tables in lyx and include them in my tex-files.

usage:

    python lyx_table_parser.py lyx_table_file1.lyx lyx_table_file2.lyx

the extracted tables will be in lyx_table_file1.tex and lyx_table_file2.tex. Pass as many lyx files as you like.
